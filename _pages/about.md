Hi! My name is Ibtihel Amara and I am a PhD student at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). 
My research revolves around finding efficient and reliable ways to compress cumbersome models into compact ones for edge devices. 
I am supervised by [Prof. James J. Clark](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~clark/) at the [McGill edge Intelligence Lab](https://meil.ece.mcgill.ca/). 

I earned my Master of Science at [École de Techologie Supérieure](https://www.etsmtl.ca/). I was part of [Laboratoire d'Imagerie, de Vision et d'Intelligence Artificielle (LIVIA)](https://liviamtl.ca/) research lab and was supervised by [Prof. Eric Granger](https://liviamtl.ca/pages/regular-members/eric-granger-copy/) and [Prof. Abdenour Hadid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Obhn_AkAAAAJ&hl=en).
