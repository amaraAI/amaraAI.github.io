Hi! I am Ibtihel Amara, a Research Scientist at Google. My work is centered on building reliable multimodal agents, with a special focus on their behavior and collaboration within multi-agent systems. 
I am passionate about ensuring the efficiency, quality, and reliability of these complex systems, and my current research interests include developing new methodologies for evaluating agents in a multimodal setting.


During my PhD at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), my research revolved around finding efficient and reliable ways to compress cumbersome models into compact ones for edge devices. 
I was supervised by [Prof. James J. Clark](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~clark/) at the [McGill edge Intelligence Lab](https://meil.ece.mcgill.ca/). 
I earned my Master of Science at [École de Techologie Supérieure](https://www.etsmtl.ca/). I was part of [Laboratoire d'Imagerie, de Vision et d'Intelligence Artificielle (LIVIA)](https://liviamtl.ca/) research lab and was supervised by [Prof. Eric Granger](https://liviamtl.ca/pages/regular-members/eric-granger-copy/) and [Prof. Abdenour Hadid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Obhn_AkAAAAJ&hl=en).
