Hi! My name is Ibtihel Amara and I am a PhD student at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). 
My research revolves around finding efficient and reliable ways to compress cumbersome models into compact ones for edge devices. 
I am supervised by [Prof. James J. Clark](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~clark/). 

I earned my Master of Research at [École de Techologie Supérieure](https://www.etsmtl.ca/). I was part of [Laboratoire d'Imagerie, de Vision et d'Intellience Artificiell (LIVIA)](https://liviamtl.ca/) research lab.
